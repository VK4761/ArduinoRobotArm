Technical Details: the robotic arm has 3 parts.
1) Mechanical 
2) Electronics 
3) Programming

A capacitive sensor used to detect ferrous
metals which then used an electromagnet to
take the object from one position to the other.
The program followed a set of mathematical
algorithms following forward kinematics.

   1. Mechanical: The Mechanical body is constructed using
   2. Electronics: HC-SR04, 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor, TowerPro MG995, KK-P20/15 Solenoid, Switch
      Relays
   3. Programming:
           a) Embedded C to perform this function via ARDUINO UNO R3.
           b) PLC via LADDER Programming and Opto-isolators.
